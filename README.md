# SumAndArithmeticMean

</br>
</br>
The task was the next:</br>
With program start to work 3(three) threads.</br>
First thread fills the array with random numbers. The other 2 threads are waiting for the first one to complete.</br>
When array completely filled, second thread calculate the sum of numbers and third calculate their avarage mean.</br>
In Main method I have to show statistic about execution result of those threads.</br>
</br>
</br>
Program operating conditions.</br>
Random numbers pick up from the range 1 - 50. Integer type. Arithmetic mean has float type.<>
</br>
</br>
Test of program.</br>
1. Enter quantity of random numbers - f.</br>
Program will show you an error. Incorrect type of input data.</br>
2. Enter quantity of random numbers - 0. Or either, you can enter - -5.</br>
Program will show you an error. Length of array should be more than 0.</br>
3. Enter quantity of random numbers. For example - 15.</br>
Program will show you the contents of array with random numbers, sum of them and avarage mean.</br>
